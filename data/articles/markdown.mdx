# Something from markdown (.md) and the superior version of markdown, markdown x (.mdx)
## Markdown
- For italic, using underscore like `_`. _It'll be appeared like this_...
- The more `#`, the smaller the header. Like the two above...
- To hyperlink, link, a or sth like that, use bracket (`[]`) and parenthesis(`()`). Like [this is the ref link](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/3/)...
- Image is the same with hyperlink but with extra exclamation point (and alt text). Like this image ![Avata](/img/avt.jpg)...
- Blockquote can be achieved with `>`. And the rule inside blockquote is the same as the outside...
> Kinda like _this_...
- List can be asterisk `*` or number. Or `-`, too...
- Double space for a soft break, like in poem...


## Markdown x
- Can throw in component from js (or jsx) file, so at least your computer must support jsx file...
- Is a programming language, so there is the problem of security...
